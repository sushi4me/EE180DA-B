## client.py & server.py
The host is defaulted to Nathan's machine (this will need to be changed
to eduroam).  Using the **-s** command you can specify the domain name
and target, for server and client respectively.  A successful connection
by the client should be aknowledged by the server and client side.
You can find the necessary **domain name pointer** by using the command
**host [IP_ADDRESS]**.
